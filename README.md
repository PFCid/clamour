_clamour_ provides a template for setting up a website to display the results of
analysis of Twitter hashtags.

## Installation

You can install the current version of clamour from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lazappi/clamour")
```

## Acknowledgements

Much of the analysis in the _clamour_ templates is originally based on work by
@neilws (and various tutorials on the internet) with contributions from
@jherrero. The _clamour_ package would not be possible without the contributions
of many developers to a range of packages, particularly _[usethis][]_ and
_[rtweet][]_.
